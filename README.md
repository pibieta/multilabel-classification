# multilabel-classification
Repository for the Albert Einstein Hospital's data science case.

The jupyter notebook with the analysis can be found [here](notebooks/multilabel-classification.ipynb), aditionally a PDF with the contents of this notebook can be found [here](reports/multilabel-classification - Jupyter Notebook.pdf).

To run the notebook we recommend to reproduce the same conda environment that was used at development time. To do this:
 * Clone the repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/pibieta/multilabel-classification.git
 ```
 * Install your favorite conda manager, for instance [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
 * Create the environment by using the `yml` file located in the environments directory, by executing:
 ```bash
 conda env create --file environment.yml
 ```
 * Run the following command at the base repository folder:
 ```bash
 jupyter notebook
 ```
 * Feel free to run the notebook.
